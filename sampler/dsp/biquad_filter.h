 * @file biquad_filter.h
 * @brief Professional biquad IIR filter implementation for audio DSP
 * 
 * Implementation of industry-standard biquad (2-pole, 2-zero) IIR filter
 * using Direct Form I topology. Supports multiple filter types commonly
 * used in audio processing and BBE sound enhancement.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Multiple filter types (LP, HP, BP, peaking, shelving, all-pass)
 * - Bilinear transform for accurate frequency response
 * - Denormal protection for numerical stability
 * - RT-safe processing with no allocations
 * - Pre-warped coefficients for minimal phase distortion
 * 
 * Mathematical Foundation:
 * Transfer function: H(z) = (b0 + b1*z^-1 + b2*z^-2) / (1 + a1*z^-1 + a2*z^-2)
 * 
 * Direct Form I difference equation:
 *   y[n] = b0*x[n] + b1*x[n-1] + b2*x[n-2] - a1*y[n-1] - a2*y[n-2]
 * 
 * Where:
 *   x[n] = current input sample
 *   y[n] = current output sample
 *   x[n-1], x[n-2] = previous input samples (state)
 *   y[n-1], y[n-2] = previous output samples (state)

/**
 * @class BiquadFilter
 * @brief Biquad IIR filter with multiple filter types
 * 
 * This class implements a versatile biquad filter suitable for:
 * - Crossover networks (Linkwitz-Riley alignment)
 * - Parametric EQ (peaking and shelving)
 * - Phase compensation (all-pass filters)
 * - General audio filtering
 * 
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 * BiquadFilter lpf;
 * lpf.setCoefficients(BiquadFilter::Type::LOWPASS, 44100, 1000.0, 0.707);
 * 
 * for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; ++i) {
 *     output[i] = lpf.processSample(input[i]);
 * }
 * @endcode
 * 
 * Thread Safety:
 * - setCoefficients() is NOT thread-safe
 * - processSample() is thread-safe if coefficients are not changed
 * - reset() is thread-safe

     * - Cascade two 2nd order sections
     * 
     * For BBE phase compensation:

     * - Use ALLPASS_360 centered at treble band (7200 Hz)
