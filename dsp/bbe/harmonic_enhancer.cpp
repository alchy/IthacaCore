/**
 * @file harmonic_enhancer.cpp
 * @brief Implementation file for HarmonicEnhancer class
 * 
 * Note: All methods are implemented inline in harmonic_enhancer.h
 * for optimal performance (compiler can inline and optimize better).
 * 
 * This file exists for:
 * - Build system consistency
 * - Future expansion if needed
 * - Potential separation of implementation from interface
 * 
 * If compile times become an issue, method implementations can be
 * moved here from the header file.
