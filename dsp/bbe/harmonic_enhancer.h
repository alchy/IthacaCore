 * @file harmonic_enhancer.h
 * @brief Dynamic harmonic enhancement processor (BBE-style treble VCA)
 * 
 * Simulates the BA3884F IC's treble VCA (Voltage Controlled Amplifier)
 * behavior for dynamic harmonic enhancement. This algorithm analyzes
 * the input signal envelope and applies adaptive gain to prevent
 * over-enhancement on already bright signals.
 * 
 * Theory of Operation:
 * ─────────────────────
 * 1. ENVELOPE DETECTION: Peak follower with asymmetric attack/release
 *    - Fast attack (10ms) to catch transients
 *    - Slow release (100ms) for smooth gain changes
 * 
 * 2. DYNAMIC GAIN CALCULATION:
 *    - More enhancement on quiet signals (add "air")
 *    - Less enhancement on loud signals (prevent harshness)
 *    - Formula: gain = 1.0 + (definition × 2.0 × (1.0 - envelope))
 * 
 * 3. GAIN SMOOTHING: Interpolate gain changes to avoid clicks
 *    - 1ms smoothing time constant
 *    - Prevents zipper noise during parameter changes
 * 
 * 4. SOFT CLIPPING: Prevents harsh digital distortion
 *    - Tanh-style soft saturation
 *    - Engages smoothly near ±1.5
 * 
 * Mathematical Model:
 * ──────────────────
 * envelope[n] = {
 *     envelope[n-1] + (|input| - envelope[n-1]) * attackCoeff,   if |input| > envelope
 *     envelope[n-1] + (|input| - envelope[n-1]) * releaseCoeff,  otherwise
 * }
 * 
 * dynamicFactor = 1.0 - min(1.0, envelope * 2.0)
 * targetGain = 1.0 + (definitionLevel * 2.0 * dynamicFactor)
 * currentGain = currentGain + (targetGain - currentGain) * smoothCoeff
 * output = softClip(input * currentGain)

/**
 * @class HarmonicEnhancer
 * @brief Dynamic treble enhancement with envelope follower
 * 
 * This class implements the BA3884F's "amplitude compensation" feature,
 * which dynamically adjusts treble gain based on input signal level.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Envelope-following VCA simulation
 * - Adaptive gain prevents over-brightening
 * - Smooth gain interpolation (no clicks)
 * - Soft clipping protection
 * - RT-safe processing (no allocations)
 * 
 * Typical Use Case (BBE Processor):
 * @code
 * HarmonicEnhancer enhancer;
 * enhancer.prepare(44100);
 * enhancer.setDefinitionLevel(0.7f);  // 70% enhancement
 * 
 * // Process treble band from crossover
 * enhancer.processBlock(trebleBand, numSamples);
 * @endcode
 * 
 * Thread Safety:
 * - prepare() must be called before processing (non-RT)
 * - setDefinitionLevel() is RT-safe (simple assignment)
 * - processBlock() is RT-safe (no allocations)
 * - reset() is RT-safe
